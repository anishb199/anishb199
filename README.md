# Hi, I'm Anish üëã

### Senior Backend & Cloud Engineer | .NET | Azure | Upskilling in Kubernetes & Event-Driven Architectures

I'm a seasoned backend and cloud engineer based in Bengaluru, with deep expertise in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable microservices within the .NET and Azure ecosystems.

My passion lies in transforming complex business requirements into robust, high-performance software. I have a proven track record of modernizing legacy systems‚Äîfor instance, I re-architected a critical scheduling process using **Azure Functions**, resulting in a **70% efficiency gain**. My experience extends to building resilient data solutions with both **SQL Server** and NoSQL databases like **Azure Cosmos DB**, and I'm adept at creating automated **CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps** to ensure seamless deployments.

While I'm proud of the fault-tolerant and data-driven systems I've built, I am a firm believer in continuous learning. I am currently channeling my passion for automation and scalable architecture into mastering the next generation of cloud-native technologies.

### üöÄ What I'm Focusing On Now (July 2025)

I am actively expanding my skill set to build even more resilient, decoupled, and scalable applications. My current learning journey is centered around:

* **Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s):** Moving beyond PaaS to orchestrating complex microservices. I am currently working on a personal project to containerize a multi-tier .NET application using **Docker** and deploy it on a managed Kubernetes cluster (**AKS**), complete with Helm charts for release management.

* **Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka:** Mastering how to effectively decouple services and handle high-throughput, real-time data streams. I'm exploring core concepts like producers, consumers, topics, and stream processing to build reactive systems.

* **Deepening my NoSQL Expertise:** Building on my production experience with **Azure Cosmos DB** by exploring other industry-leading databases like **MongoDB** to understand different use cases, data models, and query patterns.
